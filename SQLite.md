Open Source, not open contribution
created for a non server access database
most deployed and used database (trillion active use)
is found in every Android, iOS, Windows10 and more

Seems a lot like python (integrated in python):
    Flexible typing (and only five type : NULL, INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, BLOB(store binary data)) with substring match
    Primary Key can be NULL
    can have aggregate without the group by
    free single or double quoted (for identifiers or literals)
    keywords can be used as identifiers (union can be a table name)
fast (even faster than fopen)
